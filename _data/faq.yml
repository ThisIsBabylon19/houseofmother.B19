  - "#PowerToWomen":
    - "How do you support women in parliament?": "We believe there is value in fixing the justice system from the inside. That's why we work to place women in strategic, bill-drafting positions -- so that they can author laws that truly benefit women, families, and the future."
    - "Can I donate to a specific candidate or region?": "Not yet. We're still growing, so all donations go toward strengthening the organization as a whole. Every contribution helps us raise the matriachy higher and higher."
  - "#WeTheVoices":
    - "What kinds of issues can I speak out about?": "Anything that affects people's dignity, people's rights, and people's futures: education, gender-based-violence, housing, healthcare, etc. We especially encourage civic commentary on trending legislations."
    - "Do I need experience to share my opinion on a law?": "Not at all. Whether you're writing, recording a voice note, or just leaving a comment... your voice matters! Real people, real content, real impact!"
  - "#ChapterShe":
    - "What is #ChapterShe?": "#ChapterShe is our feminist book club and cadet incubator. It centers the belief that the first chapter -- of a book, a movement, or a life -- can be the start of something legendary."
    - "Do I need to be a poet or a writer to join?": "Most of the cadets are writers, these poetic dreamers make powerful activists. But it is simply a coincidence, not a requirement. Everyone is welcome to #ChapterShe; it's a book club afterall."

    - "Who can join the cadets?": "Our doors are open to women, girls, and gender-diverse individuals who believe in social change, justice and inclusion. Allies are welcome too, especially organizations."
  - "Partnerships & Allies":
